# Game_of_Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 

The game has been developed in Python, using PyGame to create the board and improve the user experience.
